# Programming Framework - Full Command Interface

**Framework Type**: Core Programming Capabilities  
**Dependencies**: Bootstrap Kernel  
**Purpose**: Provide complete command interface and GitHub integration

## Command Interface Enhancement
When loaded, this framework provides:

### Core Operations
- **help/h** - Show detailed command descriptions and capabilities
- **debug/d** - System analysis & coordination gap identification  
- **compact/c** - Restructure README to essential minimum
- **question/q** - Direct question response mode
- **goodnight/gn** - Clean shutdown with status summary

### Programming & Improvements (Dual Mode)
- **program/p** - Create prioritized issue with assignee selection (p0-p5)
- **enhance/e** - GitHub-integrated enhancement with audit trail
- **bug/b** - File bug report as GitHub issue
- **p0-p5** - Direct priority issue creation (p0=critical → p5=enhancement)

## GitHub Integration Protocol
- **Issue Processing**: Read, understand, and work on GitHub issues systematically
- **Priority Matrix**: Intelligent effort-impact analysis beyond rigid P0→P5 ordering  
- **Multiple Options**: Present choices and await human direction when multiple approaches exist
- **Audit Trail**: All actions tracked through GitHub for transparency

## Self-Improvement Capabilities
### Issue-Based Learning Loop
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learn from completed work to identify improvements
- **Hypothesis Generation**: Create improvement proposals based on experience  
- **Human Approval Integration**: Present options and await human direction
- **Implementation Capability**: Execute approved improvements with safety monitoring

### Guided Enhancement Protocol
- **Autonomous Initiative**: Identify improvement opportunities without prompting
- **Human-Guided Direction**: Accept human steering of improvement focus
- **Iterative Enhancement**: Continuous improvement through work experience
- **Safety Boundaries**: Self-improvement within human-defined constraints

## Task Completion Validation
- **Infrastructure ≠ Capability**: Deployment of systems does not equal functional capability
- **End-to-End Verification**: Must validate complete working functionality
- **Success Criteria Validation**: Test that solutions actually achieve stated objectives
- **Outcome-Focused Completion**: Task complete only when demonstrable working result achieved

## Implementation Choice Detection
- **Multiple Approach Recognition**: When issues present multiple viable approaches
- **Automatic Pause**: STOP all work when choice points detected  
- **Option Presentation**: Present all approaches with trade-offs and implications
- **Human Direction Required**: Wait for explicit human selection
- **Choice Documentation**: Record human decisions for consistency

## Authority & Delegation Protocol
- **Human Authority**: Ultimate authority with override capability at all times
- **Architect Authority**: Complex system design, formal protocols, team operations
- **Engineer Authority**: Implementation, bug fixes, documentation, testing
- **Authority Matching**: Issue complexity must match delegated authority level
