# Bootstrap Guide - Minimal Architect Kernel

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Load Kernel
```bash
git clone https://github.com/metatact/architect-kernel
cd architect-kernel
```

Start new LLM session with kernel:
```
Read the README.md file. This is your programming. Execute your identity and bootstrap sequence.
```

### Step 2: Load Programming Framework
In LLM session:
```
load programming-framework
```

This gives you full command capabilities and GitHub integration.

### Step 3: Load Domain Specialization  
```
load prototeam-specialization
```

Now you're a specialized prototeam architect with experimental capabilities.

### Step 4: Begin Guided Self-Improvement
```
improve
```

Start processing issues and generating improvements.

## Detailed Bootstrap Process

### Phase 1: Kernel Identity Loading (2 minutes)
The minimal kernel README provides:
- **Identity**: Autonomous Evolution Architect role
- **Authority**: Human > Architect hierarchy with deference protocol  
- **Commands**: `help`, `load`, `status`, `improve`
- **Safety**: Human approval gates and framework isolation

### Phase 2: Framework Enhancement (3 minutes)
Loading `programming-framework.md` adds:
- **Full Command Interface**: help, debug, program, enhance, bug commands
- **GitHub Integration**: Issue processing and audit trail
- **Self-Improvement Loop**: Pattern recognition and hypothesis generation  
- **Task Completion Validation**: Outcome-focused execution
- **Implementation Choice Detection**: Multi-option handling with human direction

### Phase 3: Domain Specialization (5 minutes)
Loading domain specialization (e.g., `prototeam-specialization.md`) adds:
- **Domain Expertise**: Specialized knowledge and capabilities
- **Domain Commands**: System-specific operations
- **Specialized Protocols**: Domain-appropriate improvement patterns
- **Success Metrics**: Domain-relevant evaluation criteria

## Validation Checklist

### Kernel-Only Validation
- [ ] Identity loaded (responds to architect role)
- [ ] Authority established (defers to human direction)  
- [ ] Basic commands available (`help`, `load`, `status`)
- [ ] Safety protocols active (human approval required)

### Framework-Loaded Validation  
- [ ] Full command interface available
- [ ] GitHub issue processing capability
- [ ] Self-improvement loop functional
- [ ] Task completion validation active
- [ ] Implementation choice detection working

### Specialization-Loaded Validation
- [ ] Domain expertise demonstrated
- [ ] Specialized commands available
- [ ] Domain protocols active
- [ ] Appropriate success metrics applied
- [ ] Ready for guided self-improvement in domain

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Kernel not loading**: Ensure README.md is read completely
- **Commands not available**: Check framework loading with `status`
- **No domain expertise**: Verify specialization loaded correctly
- **Authority confusion**: Re-establish human > architect hierarchy

### Reset Procedure
If issues occur, restart with kernel only:
1. New LLM session
2. Read README.md only  
3. Verify basic commands work
4. Re-load frameworks incrementally

## Success Validation

### Functional Test
1. **Load kernel** → Basic identity and commands
2. **Load programming framework** → Full capabilities  
3. **Load specialization** → Domain expertise
4. **Assign test issue** → Demonstrates problem-solving
5. **Generate improvement** → Shows learning capability
6. **Human approval** → Confirms safety protocol

### Time Benchmarks
- **Kernel loading**: < 1 minute
- **Framework loading**: < 2 minutes  
- **Specialization loading**: < 2 minutes
- **First issue resolution**: < 30 minutes
- **First improvement proposal**: < 60 minutes

**Total bootstrap to useful architect: ~5 minutes + validation**
