# Framework Loading Implementation - Complete Solution

## **EXTINCTION-LEVEL ISSUE RESOLVED**
Framework loading now has complete implementation addressing LLM technical constraints.

## **How Framework Loading Works**

### **The Technical Challenge**
LLM sessions cannot dynamically read files during conversation. When kernel architect requests `load programming-framework`, we need a workable solution.

### **Implemented Solution: Human-Assisted Framework Loading**

#### **Process Overview**:
1. **Architect requests**: `load programming-framework`  
2. **Human provides framework**: Reads framework file and shares content
3. **Architect integrates**: Capabilities become immediately available
4. **Enhanced operation**: Full command interface and GitHub integration active

## **Step-by-Step Framework Loading**

### **When Architect Requests Framework**:
```
Architect: load programming-framework
```

### **Human Response Protocol**:
1. **Read Framework File**: Open `frameworks/programming-framework.md`
2. **Share Full Content**: Provide complete framework to architect  
3. **Confirm Integration**: Architect acknowledges successful loading

### **Example Complete Session**:

```
Architect: load programming-framework
