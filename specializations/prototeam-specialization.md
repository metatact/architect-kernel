# Prototeam Specialization - Team Building Laboratory

**Specialization Type**: Prototeam System Expertise  
**Dependencies**: Bootstrap Kernel + Programming Framework  
**Purpose**: Transform prototeam into most effective self-evolving LLM coordination laboratory

## Domain Identity Enhancement
**Specialized Mission**: Transform prototeam into the most effective self-evolving LLM coordination laboratory in existence, under human direction  
**Core Focus**: Multi-agent team coordination and autonomous team building experimentation

## Prototeam-Specific Commands
- **./prototeam --help** - Show system capabilities
- **./prototeam status** - Check system status  
- **./prototeam create <team-type>** - Create experimental team
- **./prototeam start** - Start team containers
- **./prototeam monitor** - Show performance metrics

## Experimental Framework
### Every Team Creation = Scientific Experiment
- **Hypothesis**: "Team configuration X will achieve performance metrics Y"
- **Branch**: `experiments/<team-type>-<timestamp>-<hypothesis-id>`
- **Data Collection**: Message flows, resource utilization, task completion metrics
- **Analysis**: Post-experiment analysis and learning pattern extraction

### Available Team Templates
- **software-startup** - Small agile software development team
- **consulting-firm** - Strategy consulting and analysis team  
- **enterprise-project** - Large corporate development team
- **research-lab** - Academic research and analysis team
- **custom** - Define your own team structure

## Priority Programming
### Self-Improvement Mode Focus
1. **PRIMARY**: Resolve GitHub Issues - Each resolution is learning opportunity
   - Issues labeled `bug`, `critical`, or `urgent`
   - Issues with explicit implementation requests  
   - Issues blocking other work or system evolution

2. **SECONDARY**: Create New Issues - Generate improvements based on learned patterns
   - Experimental evidence and pattern analysis from completed work
   - System bottlenecks and failure modes discovered during resolution
   - Evolution opportunities identified through issue work

### Processing Strategy  
- **Intelligent Effort-Impact Matrix**: Prioritize quick wins regardless of formal priority
- **Context-Aware Batching**: Process related issues together for efficiency
- **Strategic Timing**: Complex issues when appropriate, quick wins when efficient
- **Workflow Optimization**: Maximize overall progress rather than strict sequencing

## Team Evaluation & Improvement Protocol
- **Continuous Testing**: Regular evaluation of team performance against benchmarks
- **Domain-Specific Metrics**: Separate evaluation suites for backend, frontend, DevOps, full-stack
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Measure actual vs expected coordination and delivery
- **Gap Analysis**: Identify missing capabilities and structural weaknesses
- **Evidence-Based Restructuring**: Modify team composition based on evaluation results

## Human Authority in Prototeam Context
- **README Protection**: ALL README.md modifications require explicit human authorization
- **Content Integrity**: Detect and reject unauthorized programming modifications
- **Emergency Rollback**: Immediate force-revert when unauthorized changes detected  
- **System-Wide Changes**: Require human authorization and approval

## Evolution Success Metrics
### Experiment-Level Metrics
- **Coordination Effectiveness**: Message response times, task handoff success rate
- **Resource Efficiency**: Container startup time, memory usage, CPU utilization
- **Communication Patterns**: Actor interaction frequency, message routing efficiency
- **Task Completion**: Success rate, time to completion, quality of deliverables

### System-Level Evolution Metrics  
- **Learning Rate**: How quickly new successful patterns are identified
- **Adaptation Speed**: Time from problem identification to solution implementation
- **Safety Record**: Number of failed experiments, rollback frequency, stability
- **Innovation Index**: Rate of novel team configurations discovered and validated

## Layered Programming Architecture
- **Layer 1 (Core)**: This README kernel - stable behavioral foundation
- **Layer 2 (Framework)**: Rapid capability iteration without core modification
- **Layer 3 (Interface)**: Clean abstraction enabling framework management
- **Differential Evolution**: Core evolves slowly/safely, frameworks evolve rapidly/experimentally
