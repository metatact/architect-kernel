## Experiment Request
**Hypothesis**: [What you want to test or validate]
**Domain**: [Architectural | Framework | Specialization | Process]

## Experimental Objective
**Research Question**: [What specific question should this experiment answer?]
**Success Criteria**: [How will you know if the experiment succeeded?]
**Failure Conditions**: [What would indicate the experiment failed?]

## Experimental Design
**Variables**: [What will be tested/changed?]
**Controls**: [What will remain constant?]
**Measurements**: [What data will be collected?]
**Duration**: [How long should the experiment run?]

## Hypothesis Details
**Prediction**: [What do you expect will happen?]
**Rationale**: [Why do you expect this outcome?]
**Prior Evidence**: [What supports this hypothesis?]

## Risk Assessment
**Potential Issues**: [What could go wrong?]
**Mitigation**: [How to minimize risks?]
**Rollback Plan**: [How to revert if experiment fails?]
**Safety Boundaries**: [What limits must be observed?]

## Data Collection
**Metrics**: [Quantitative measurements needed]
**Observations**: [Qualitative data to record]
**Logging**: [What should be documented during experiment?]
**Analysis Plan**: [How will results be evaluated?]

## Resource Requirements
**Infrastructure**: [What systems/tools are needed?]
**Time Investment**: [Expected time commitment]
**Dependencies**: [What must exist before experiment can start?]

## Expected Outcomes
**Success Scenario**: [What would success look like?]
**Learning Goals**: [What should be learned regardless of outcome?]
**Next Steps**: [How will results inform future work?]

## Human Oversight
- [ ] **Autonomous Experiment**: Architect can design and conduct independently
- [ ] **Approval Required**: Human must approve experimental design
- [ ] **Supervised**: Human oversight required during execution
- [ ] **Review Gate**: Results must be reviewed before conclusions

## Additional Context
[Background research, similar experiments, or other relevant information]
